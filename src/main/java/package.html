        <h1>Default package</h1>
        This package contains the class that can be invoked from the command
        line. Although it is not recommended to place any class into the
        default package, here <tt>Velocitoro</tt> is to ease the invocation
        of Velocitoro from the command line and lessen the necccessary typing.
