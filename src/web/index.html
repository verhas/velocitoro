            <p class="texto">
                Velocitoro is a Maven 2.0 plugin. It creates web site
                documentation for your project.
                #set( $a = $groovy.invoke("test.groovy","aaa") )
                $a
            </p>
            <p class="texto">
                Note that this plugin does not replace the standard 'site'
                plugin. It has different aim. While 'site' creates technical
                documentation, velocitoro is aiming to create <i>"marketing"</i>
                documentation.
            </p>
            <p class="texto">
                Usage in short: Create the web site in <tt>src/web</tt>.
                executing <tt>mvn com.verhas.maven:maven-velocitoro-plugin:velocitoro</tt>
                will copy all files (except those that have extension <tt>.vmi</tt>
                or <tt>.vm</tt> to <tt>target/web</tt>. After this velocitoro
                will process all files that have a "shadow" file with the
                extension <tt>.vm</tt> using Apache Velocity and overwrite the
                original copied content.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter">What is a shadow file?</p>
            <p class="texto">
                Note that if there is a file <tt>index.html.vm</tt> and
                <tt>index.html</tt> then the latter will be processed. The shadow
                file <tt>index.html.vm</tt> may have any content: it is ignored.
                It's sole purpose is to indicate that <tt>index.html</tt> has to
                be processed.
            </p>
            <p class="texto">
                Why not processing <tt>index.html.vm</tt>? Because this way
                your IDE editor can rely on the extension
                of the file and guess the type of the content file when you edit.
                If your html is not totally mixed up with Velocity macros
                you may still get a kind of draft view in a browser without
                executing velocitoro.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter">.vmi files?</p>
            <p class="texto">
                What are <tt>.vmi</tt> files? The are totally ignored except you
                can <tt>#</tt><tt>parse</tt> them from any file that is processed
                using velocity.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter">Name of the game</p>
            <p class="texto">
                Velocitoro was not found by Google. It sounds Spanish and it is
                cool. Velocity means what it means: "distance travelled per unit
                time" and 'toro' means bull. Thus velocitoro is something like a 'fast bull' .
